<h1>E-learning Reinvented</h1><div class="orange_font">The end of scrap learning</div><p>Long term retention is key, but it's not happening. Blink utilizes frequent reinforcement, distributed practice and optimal use of feedback to create an interactive dialog between the learner and the content. Teachable moments are optimized. Scrap learning is minimized.</p><div class="orange_font">The end of training as an event</div><p>To successfully master new content, training must be ongoing, not thirty minutes once or twice a month. Blink training is a continual journey – employees can train anywhere, anytime on their mobile devices, in three to five minute bursts at a time.</p><div class="orange_font">The end of boring voiceovers and tiresome images</div><p>Blink teaches by questioning. If it was good enough for Socrates, it's good enough for teaching HR compliance or management skills or the advantages of a new medication. Blink courses are broken down into short and sweet bursts that are immediate, engaging and impactful.</p><div class="orange_font">The end of inconsistent interfaces and learning curves</div><p>All Blink courses are created with the same proprietary editor. The interface is consistent from course to course so there's no learning curve and employees can get right to the content.</p><div class="red_font">The beginning of e-learning that works, so your employees can work better</div><p>Blink is an essential alternative – or reinforcement – to traditional e-learning. The Blink 'short bursts' model is supported by state of the art research and fits your employees' mobile information and entertainment lifestyle – with your company's courses easily accessed via the Blink app on iOS and Android devices.</p><br/>

            <h1>Supported by state-of-the-art research</h1><div class="orange_font">Distributed Practice</div><p>The Blink pedagogical model of short bursts over extended periods of time is supported by Seabrook, Brown and Solity (2005) who showed that recall of words among various age groups was six times greater with three two-minute daily sessions vs. one six-minute daily session.  That same year, Rawson and Kintsch reported that college students who re-read a text with a week delay vs. two times immediately one after the other increased their long term retention of the content.</p><div class="orange_font">Cognitive Load Theory</div><p>This theory states that humans have a limited amount of working memory capacity and so training material should minimize extraneous 'noise' so the learner can optimize their focus and capacity. Blink adheres to this concept with a minimalist design that keeps the GUI simple and consistent and unnecessary art and audio to a minimum.</p><div class="orange_font">Variable Interval Reward Schedule</div><p>A variable schedule of rewards has proven to maintain motivation longer than a fixed schedule. Blink employs a variable schedule in rewarding gems so as to help keep the learner motivated.</p><div class="orange_font">Diverse Set of Delivery Media</div><p>Blink can stand on its own as a learning platform, but can also play an important role as part of a diverse set of delivery media which can spread practice over time. Such a diverse set of media has been found to improve long-term learning.</p>
